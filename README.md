Factors Influencing Residential Properties Sales Price Pre- Covid and Post-Covid and A Machine Learning Approach on Predicting Market Value in 2023 for Residential Properties.

This study investigates the significant features influencing the sales price of residential properties both pre and post Covid-19, aiming to identify potential variations in factors affecting property values during these periods. In addition, we aim to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the total market value of residential properties.
The impact of Covid-19 on various industries, including real estate, has been substantial, and understanding the changes in property sales dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions in the current market. By comparing the influential features for residential property sales price pre and post Covid-19, we seek to uncover any shifts in market demand and preferences that may have occurred due to the pandemic.
To ensure a homogeneous subset of properties, the dataset is narrowed down to a specific time range, reducing the impact of outliers, and ensuring that the properties considered share similar characteristics and market conditions. This approach enhances the reliability and accuracy of our predictions.
Overall, this study seeks to contribute valuable insights into the factors influencing residential property sales prices both pre and post Covid-19, and to develop an effective machine learning model for predicting the total market value in 2023 for residential properties built in the last ten years. The findings may provide valuable guidance for real estate professionals, investors, and policymakers in navigating the dynamic real estate market and to make informed decisions.
